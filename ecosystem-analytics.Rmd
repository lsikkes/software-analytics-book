# Ecosystem Analytics

Software ecosystems are a combination of systems that a community of developers use to maintain 
their software projects. By doing analysis on these systems people hope to find meaningful insights
that could lead to improvements of the software development process. For our literature review we
started with the initial seed of papers that was given to us. After reviewing them we have decided
that we would not use one, and that we had 3 that were debatable. In the table below we have made
an overview of all these papers. The first column describes whether we are going to use them. A 
'+' means we will use it, a '-' means we will not, and empty means we are still unsure. The 
keywords are the actual keywords from the paper.
